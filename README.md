# SemanticRetrieval-RAG-using-LangChain 

LangChain-RAG is a project that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and OpenAI's language models. This project demonstrates how to use LangChain for document retrieval and embedding, and OpenAI's API for generating responses based on the retrieved documents from **Websites**. 

## Project Structure

`document_processor.py`: Handles loading, splitting, and embedding documents.
`rag_process.py`: Contains the RAGProcess class for creating and querying the RAG model.
`setup.py`: Script to install required packages.
`run.py`: Main script to run the RAG process.
